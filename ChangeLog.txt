0.4.0 Major new features!
   This list highlights the main changes from 0.3.1 to 0.4.0. Read the
   previous changelogs for minor improvements and details.
   
   + Compiles with Scilab <= 5.1
	 + Translated most help files to Scilab 5. Help us translate more!
   + new DCT function by Angus Errington
   + new features in interferometry_gui by jocelyn
   + NEW hsv2rgb and rgb2hsv functions to convert between RGB images 
     and HSV (Hue Saturation Intensity) images.
   + NEW radon and iradon functions
   + NEW sip_set_verbose, sip_quiet and sip_wordy functions to adjust 
     the messaging level issued by sip routines. For instance, this

     messages.
   + NEW sip_setenv to set environment variables.
   + imvariance is now coded in C for efficiency
   + unwrapl and unwrapp functions are now coded in C. unwrapl now 
     returns the unwrapped_phase and the phase_jumps.
   + NEW rgbplot function to plot the RGB components of a colormap
   + NEW sip_colormap function
   + FIX to imread: when you read a non-indexed image (such as
     truecolor or binary) with two output parameters, imread crashed 
     scilab in some cases. This is now fixed. (thx to )
   + FIX regarding truecolor images in imwrite, imread and mogrify 
     functions, by using scilab's new hypermatrix structure.
   + imwrite now supports the "depth" optional argument to set image 
     depth. It defaults to 16bpp, but one can now set it to 8bpp.
   + Help files moved to XML/HTML format and were totally revised;
   + CVS repository at Source Forge started by Angus Errington 
   + GANDALF is NOT needed anymore for the a source build
   + Animal 0.15.0 or later is required for a source build
   + Virtually any version of ImageMagick is now supported for 
     compiling from source (all versions from current 6.5.x down to 5.4.2)
   + New beta installer for Windows by Zhang Cheng
   + Both sabcmd and xsltproc are supported to build the help pages; 
     SIP will use whichever is available.
   + Meijster's exact Euclidean distance tranform algorithm included in bwdist.
   It is faster than all the others in most cases.
   + Fixed bug in erode
   + NEW preliminary imxprofile, wich has some improvements to 
     improfile but is not fully functional.
   + INCOMPATIBLE: function angle changed to "getangle"
   + Many other bugfixes and minor improvements

   Main Developers: Ricardo Fabbri, Zhang Cheng, and Jocelyn Druel.
   Special Thanks to: Sandro da Silva, Leandro Estrozi, Edson 
   Nakamura, Dean Messing, Enrico Segre, Torsten Werner


0.4.0 RC5
   + 20070831 Added backward support for ImageMagick 6.2.4 
   + Mogrify now works with ImageMagick 6.3.3
   + Meijster's exact Euclidean distance tranform algorithm included in bwdist.
   It is faster than all the others in most cases.
   + New beta installer for Windows by Zhang Cheng
   + Fixed bug in erode

0.4.0 RC2
   + Fix to poledetection.xml help page


0.4.0 RC1
   + FIXED small syntax error in imroi.sci
   + Binaries are available

20040710-2
   + fixed small bug where the file "builder.sce" was not included 
   (thx. Torsten)
   

20040710
   + NEW hsv2rgb and rgb2hsv functions to convert between RGB images 
     to HSV colorspace images. It also works for colormaps.  (thx.  
     Sandro da Silva)
   + NEW radon and iradon functions (by Leandro Estrozi)
   + FIX regarding truecolor images in imwrite, imread and mogrify 
     functions, by using scilab's new hypermatrix structure.
   + NEW sip_set_verbose, sip_quiet and sip_wordy functions to adjust 
     the messaging level issued by sip routines. For instance, this 
     may be used to stop imread and mogrify from issuing verbose 
     messages, which are very annoying when these functions are used 
     inside loops.
   + NEW sip_setenv to set environment variables.
   + unwrapl and unwrapp functions are now coded in C (by Jocelyn 
     Druel). unwrapl now returns the unwrapped_phase and the 
     phase_jumps to be consistent with the unwrapp function.
   + INCOMPATIBLE: improvements to imxprofile, new parameters
   + NEW threshold parameter for unwrapp
   + improvements to the interferometry GUI - Gamma correction on 
     colormaps, use of imxprofile instead of improfile, and more.
   + INCOMPATIBLE: function angle changed to "getangle" because 
     "angle" is too simple and often conflicts with user variables.
   + dummy builder.sce file so that Scilab includes SIP in the
     toolboxes menu (thx. Enrico Segre).
   + many fixes and improvements to help pages

20040527-2
   + the new help pages weren't loadable in scilab 2.7, only in 
   scilab 3.0 RC1. It now works with both versions.

20040527
   + GANDALF IS NOT NEEDED ANYMORE; this dependency gave
   way too much trouble for nothing; it is too hard to build and
   yet we use just a small part of it. We also started to merge
   Gandalf into Animal.
   + Animal 0.13.0 or later is REQUIRED

20040523 Important improvements to the build process
   + ImageMagick 6 is now supported (in addition to older versions 
   down to 5.4.2), although there is a BUG in ImageMagick 6 that makes 
   some images not to be read. The support for older versions is now
   very robust, as we added many feature checks in the configure script
   + imwrite now supports the "depth" optional argument to set image 
   depth. It defaults to 16bpp, but one can now set it to 8bpp.
   + both sabcmd and xsltproc are supported to build the help pages; 
   SIP will use whichever is available.
   + using up-to-date libtool 1.5.6, autoconf 2.59, and automake 1.8.5

20040520
   + bugfix to imread: when you read a non-indexed image (such as
   truecolor or binary) with two output parameters, imread crashed
   scilab in some cases. This is now fixed. (thx to D. Messing)
   + new rgbplot function to plot the RGB components of a colormap
   + imvariance is now coded in C for efficiency
   + new preliminary imxprofile, wich has some improvements to 
   improfile but is not fully functional.
   + Thx to J. Druel for the last 3 items above.

20040428
   + Help files in XML format were all totally revised
   + new sip_colormap function (wasn't included before by mistake)
   + bwdist returns undefined image and a warning in case the input
   has every pixel different than 0.
   + Scilab scripts are now installed w/o exec perms (thx Torsten)
   + Sources ".sci" corresponding to ".bin" files are now installed
   + Enhanced example for gsm (1D Gaussian Smoothing)

20040320 Changes to the help system only
   + some help files (e.g. mogrify.xml) now have all the sections;
   + we now use our own XSL and DTD for the help files
   + configure now requires xsltproc program
   + old man files being distributed so people can match to the
   new XML files and fix them to include the now-supported sections.

20040314
   + help files moved to XML format; there are still some features
   missing, such as REMARKS and some other manual sections.

0.3.1
   + watershed - fixed an error in the interface between Scilab
   + imshow - in the double-buffered mode xset('pixmap',1), 
   the user doesn't need to issue xset('wshow'); imshow does it.
   + Demos are faster: use double-buffering to show images; affects
   introductory demo and mogrify demo.

0.3.0  Major new features!
   This list highlights the main changes from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0. Read the
   previous changelogs for minor improvements and details.

   + NEW bwlabel function to label connected components in a binary image.
   + NEW watershed function, for image segmentation. It accepts
     markers.  There is a nice example in the help page, showing how
     to separate overlying objects in a binary image.
   + NEW bwdist function with very fast euclidean distance transform 
     algorithms: Olivier Cuisenaire's algorithm (CVIU 1999) and Calvin Maurer's 
     algorithm (PAMI 2003). Probably the fastest exact methods anywhere.
     There is also a nice example in the help page for "bwdist".
   + NEW imroi function to define ROI's (Regions of Interest) using 
     the mouse. Rectangle and ellipse selections are supported. 
   + NEW imnoise function, to generate a few types of noise, such as
     gaussian white noise, salt & pepper, and more.
   + NEW thin function (Zhang-Suen thinning)
   + sipdemo is now called by "exec(SIPDEMO)"
   + INCOMPATIBLE: Double-precision Images are now normalized like M4t1ab:

          TYPE OF IMAGE           SIZE          VALUE RANGE    
              Grayscale images     2D               0-1
              Truecolor images     3D (RGB)         0-1    
        Paletted images, index     2D               1-NC (Number of Colors)
     Paletted images, colormap    NCx3              0-1

     This has many advantages. For instance, imwrite and imshow doesn't require 
     normalization to obscure values such as 255 or 65535.
   + NEW GUI demo, mainly for interferometry images
   + NEW mogrify demo
   + mogrify now supports color images, and has a roubust error treatment.
     All operations such as rotation, zoom, and color segmentation
     are now working for these images. There is a nice example in the help page.
   + INCOMPATIBLE: mogrify's drawing commands and many other 
     functionalities are now working. An INCOMPATIBLE improvement 
     has been made so more complex operations are now possible.  
     For example, to rotate an image:
     BEFORE:   mogrify(image, '-rotate 60');      // WRONG
     NOW   :   mogrify(image, ['-rotate', '60']); // CORRECT
     The advantage is that you can now do this:
     mogrify(image, ['+antialias'; '-draw'; 'ellipse 50,50 30,30 0,360']);
     For one argument without parameter, nothing has changed:
     mogrify(image, '-equalize');  // histogram equalization
   + INCOMPATIBLE: drawline function has been changed & fixed. 
     It was previously broken.  Thx to Marconi for reporting.
   + INCOMPATIBLE: improfile changed 
   + INCOMPATIBLE: fftshift was renamed to sip_fftshift, because
     Scilab CVS now provides an fftshift.
   + NEW mkfftfilter function to provide frequency-domain filter kernels.
   + NEW ind2rgb function to convert indexed images to direct RGB 
     hypermatrix storage.
   + NEW gray_imread function, to read every image as grayscale
   + NEW perim function, to compute the perimeter of a shape
   + NEW imvariance - image local variance 
   + NEW pifilter - denoises an image without affecting abrupt variations.
   + NEW imphase - phase calculation (useful for interferometry)
   + NEW unwrapp - phase unwrapping by path following, used in
     interferometry/photonics
   + NEW poledetection function to detect residues in wrapped phased 
     images.
   + NEW SIP manual by Jocelyn Druel: 
      http://genie-optique.chez.tiscali.fr/SIP
   + FIXED memleaks in various C functions (thx. to Linder). Corrected
     functions are: imread, bwlabel, thin, skel, bwdist, drawline, mogrify
   + FIXED bug in minmax function
   + imshow is faster for truecolor images, because it now uses less colors.
   + im2gray is now much faster
   + Error messages are now more descriptive in imread, imwrite, imfinfo 
     and mogrify. 
   + Many other bugfixes and minor improvements
   + Depends on: Animal 0.10.4 (or later required), ImageMagick 5.5.7 
   (recommended), and Gandalf library 1.3.2 (recommended).  


20040201
   + INCOMPATIBLE IMPROVEMENT: all arguments to mogrify are now working!
   But now mogrify's "argv" argument now a string vector for options
   with parameters. For example, suppose "image" is a scilab array:
   BEFORE: mogrify(image, '-rotate 60');      // WRONG
   NOW   : mogrify(image, ['-rotate', '60']); // CORRECT

   This way, options like "draw" and many others are now working!!
   An example:

   mogrify(image, ['+antialias'; '-draw'; 'ellipse 50,50 30,30 0,360']);

   this, of course, equalizes the image and draws an ellipse, all in one
   command and all done in memory. If only one string is present you may
   type as before:

   mogrify(image, '-equalize');  // histogram equalization

   + Error treatment in mogrify is now robust and descriptive. In previous
   versions, mogrify didn't report errors if the parameters were wrong.
   + Error messages are now more descriptive in imread, imwrite, imfinfo 
   and mogrify. 
   + This release was tested with ImageMagick 5.5.7 and Animal 0.10.1

20040130
   + mogrify working w/ truecolor and paletted images!
   + im2gray now converts indexed images to a 0-255 Grayscale img,
   so that a simple imshow without normalization will work.  
   + imshow for truecolor imgs has now an optional parameter to set the
   number of levels of sampling to use for color reduction before plotting.
   And, by default, the number of levels is 9 levels per channel (which gives
   9^3 = 729 colors), and is much faster to display in Scilab. BTW, scilab has
   only a limited number of colors and is slow for setting colormaps.

20040127
   + New extremely fast euclidean distance tranform algorithms were added to
   bwdist: Olivier Cuisenaire's algorithm (CVIU 1999) and Calvin Maurer's 
   algorithm (PAMI 2003). These seem to be the fastest exact methods available!
   There is also a nice example in the help page for "bwdist".
   + bwdist no
   + Works with Animal 0.10.1

20040115
   + Fixed memleaks in various C functions (thx. to Linder). Corrected
   functions are: imread, bwlabel, thin, skel, bwdist, drawline, mogrify
   + Fixed severe memleaks in bwdist. (thx. to Linder)
   + Fixed Bug in imshow regarding to indexed images (thx. Marconi). 
   As a side effect, this fixes a bug in SIP's introductory demo.
   + New ellipse selection in function imroi. (thx. to Jocelyn).
   + New ind2rgb function to convert indexed images to direct RGB 
   hypermatrix storage.
   + New poledetection function to detect residues in wrapped phased 
   images.
   + Many other bugfixes and minor improvements

20031219
   + New bwlabel function to label connected components in a binary 
   image. It is coded in C for efficiency.

   * Contributions by Jocelyn Druel:
   + New pifilter function that denoises an image without affecting 
   abrupt variations.
   + New imroi function to define ROI's (Regions of Interest) using 
   the mouse. Until now only rectangular regions are supported. 

   + INCOMPATIBILITY: fftshift was renamed to sip_fftshift, because
   Scilab CVS now provides an fftshift.


20031216
   + Minor fixes

20031212
   + The building procedure was updated with the trio autoconf 
   2.58, automake 1.8 and libtool 1.5

20031126
   + watershed with markers wasn't working. Fixed.


20030923
   + fixed a bug in bwdist (Lotufo-Zampirolli EDT implementation)
   regarding a mysterious black line on the top of the image.
   + started an imcorrcoef template matching function.
   Don't use it yet, since we must first improve the imconv routine.
   + small bugfix to im2bw regarding indexed images.
   + new xor convenience function 

20030811
   + New function: watershed, for image segmentation. It accepts
   markers.  There is a nice example in the help page, showing how
   to separate overlying objects in a binary image.
   + Requires Animal 0.7.0

20030804
   + New function: bwdist, for distance tranform. A new very fast
   exact euclidean method is available (Lotufo-Zampirolli 2001).
   + New function: imnoise, to generate a few types of noise, such as
   gaussian white noise, salt & pepper, and more.
   + im2gray and gray_imread are now much faster
   + im2bw threshold is by default taken relatively to the maximum value
   of the image, instead of 255. This approach is more convenient.
   + autoreconf now works without any error messages

20030527
   + function drawline: incompatible changes and bugfix. It was
   previously broken. Thx to Marconi for reporting.

20030525
   + new "thin" (standard Zhang-Suen thinning) implemented in C
   + gray_imread (simply to read every image as grayscale) manpage
   + improfile changed (it is now incompatible with the previous one)
   + manpage for perim
   + new example figures
   + requires Animal 0.5.0

20030522 many contribs thx to Jocelyn Druel
   + fixed bug in minmax
   + new GUI demo
   + sipdemo is now called by "exec(SIPDEMO)"
   + new imvariance - image local variance 
   + new imphase - phase calculation (useful for interferometry)
   + new unwrapp - phase unwrapping by path following, used in
     interferometry/photonics
   + loader.sce now displays SIP version
   + manpage fixes

0.2.0 Major feature enhancements!
   This list summarizes the changes from 0.1.1 to 0.2.0.

   + New mogrify command (resizing, rotating, filtering, etc)
   + New state-of-the-art O(n) skeletonization algorithm based
     on the euclidean metric, implemented in C and accessible
     through the scilab function "skel".  It has a multiscale
     pruning parameter.
   + Fast euclidean distance transform and discrete Voronoi 
     diagram calculated by the same algorithm.
   + New xgetpixel command to get pixel coordinates from mouse
     position
   + New edilate command to do exact euclidean dilation
   + New percol command to check for image percolation
   + New drawline command to draw a line in an image
   + New perim function (perimeter measure of a shape)
   + minmax - new min/max noise removal from images (by curvature/levelsets)
   + New Hough transform (early working implementation)
   + Early fractal dimension implementation
   + Curvature/ffteriv/gsm/gsm2d rewrite
   + Curvature2d - estimates the curvature of a surface / image
   + Improfile - plot data profiles along line segments through an image
   + Imshow is now faster for truecolor images. 
   + Adaptive thresholding though the mogrify parameter "-lat". This 
     requires ImageMagick 5.5.2 or later.
   + New edge-detection by FFT gradient estimation; this
     is available in the 'edge' routine, by giving an 'fftderiv' value 
     for the method argument. 
   + New masks for mkfilter - laplacian masks, low-pass masks, sharp
     masks, mean, and circular.
   + New unwrapl function - unwraps phased images linearly
   + Imshow has new strf parameter
   + Imshow is now faster for truecolor images. 
   + No more need to normalize truecolor images to 0-65535 range 
     for imshow. This means you can now call imshow(im), 
     and _not_ imshow(im*65535), if 0 <= im(i,j,k) <= 255
   + No more need to fix Scilab makefile bugs to compile SIP. The
     build process is now based on autoconf, which means the user
     types "configure; make; make install" to compile SIP (only
     POSIX-like environments are supported).
   + A "hello_sip" function added as a simple example, for new 
     developers, of how to add a new C-language routine to SIP.
   + The general purpose C routines were moved to AnImaL (An Imaging
     Library), which is independent of Scilab.
   + Many bugfixes


20030315
   + New unwrapl function - unwraps phased images linearly
   + improfile bugfix
   + imshow is a little faster for truecolor images
   + new masks for mkfilter - laplacian masks, low-pass masks, sharp
     masks, mean, and circular.

20030307.1
   + images/bin.xpm was not being included (fixed)
   + whatis file didn't have the new functions (fixed)

20030307   
   + minmax - new min/max noise removal from images (curvature/levelset)
   + curvature2d - estimates the curvature of a surface / image
   + improfile - plot data profiles along line segments through an image
   + imshow is now faster for truecolor images. 
   + No more need to normalize truecolor images to 0-65535 range 
     for imshow. This means you can now call imshow(im), 
     and _not_ imshow(im*65535), if 0 <= im(i,j,k) <= 255
   + mkfilter has new "circular" mask
   + manual for edilate function
   + fix in manual for dilate function

20030306
   + full support for autoconf (./configure; make; make install),
     with automatic detection of scilab and external libraries.
   + txt files updated for the next release
   + imshow is faster for truecolor images, thx to A. Calio.
     (note that B. Pincon's changes have not yet been comited)
   + no instructions for binaries yet

20030305.1
   + This is the first full-featured sip-dev release of 2003.
   + build system improved
   + man, images and .txt files included

20030305
   + macros included
   + still no images or help pages
   + build system improved

20030304
   + Preliminary autoconf support
   + install only with ./configure; make; make install
   + Needs animal.sf.net (An IMAge Library) to be installed.
   + No macros nor man
   + New perim function

20021203
   + New edge-detection by FFT gradient estimation; this
     is available in the 'edge' routine, by giving an 'fftderiv'
     value for the method argument. The manpage was updated to
     contain more info on this.
   + New hough transform (early working implementation)
   + Adaptive thresholding though the mogrify parameter "-lat".   
     This needs the new ImageMagick 5.5.2.
   + Gsm2d rewrite; about 5 to 10% speedup.
   + bwborder was broken; fixed.
   + Drawline manpage

20021125
   + curvature/ffteriv/gsm rewrite (not definite, though)
   + simple filename fix of the test suite inside "tst" directory

20021123
   + compilation was failing; fixed builder.sce files in src.

20021121.1
   + A "hello_sip" function added as a simple example, for new 
     developers, of how to add a new C-language routine to SIP.
   + A hello_sip help page written as a starting point for new
     developers.

20021121
   + Early fractal dimension implementation

20021105
   + Scilab 2.6 bugfix necessary to compile was wrong in INSTALL.txt
     It is not  EXTRA_LD_FLAGS, but EXTRA_LDFLAGS, a simple mistake
     that can corrupt the installation.
   + Removed nonsense mogrify parameters from the help page.
   + Development versioning scheme is changed to eliminate the dashes. 
     The version number is now a single increasing number formed by
     the date of release. 

2002-10-31
   + Bugfix in internal euclidean structure (affects "skel" and
     "edilate" routines).
   + Parameter "full" in the previous "skel" routine documentation 
     is actually "both".

2002-10-30
   + New state-of-the-art O(n) skeletonization algorithm based
     on the euclidean metric, implemented in C and accesible
     through the scilab function "skel".  It has a multiscale
     pruning parameter.
   + Fast euclidean distance transform and discrete Voronoi 
     diagram calculated by the same algorithm.
   + Skeletonization now accepts shapes with holes and more than 
     one shape in the input image.
   + SIP now builds on both Scilab 2.6 stable and CVS.
   + Minor bug fixes in some other routines

2002-09-25 Major updates in this release!
   + C code now implements many functions
   + new mogrify command (resizing, rotating, filtering, etc)
   + new skel command (skeletonization + distance transform +
     discrete Voronoi diagram) with scale-space skeleton detail
     filtering, and exact euclidean metric.
   + new xgetpixel command to get pixel coordinates from mouse
     position
   + new edilate command to do exact euclidean dilation
   + new percol command to do image percolation
   + new drawline command to draw a line in an image
   + imwrite bug fix ("Pixel cache not open" message is now gone)
   + imshow has new strf parameter
   + documentation updated
   + various minor fixes
   + SIP has a total of 27 routines now; mogrify alone is worth
     about 10 routines!

0.1.1 
   + "gsm" function got better but compatible. The user may
   select if input or output is in time (real), complex
   or frequency, enabling more effective use of FFT's.
   + "fftderiv" now enables input to be in time (real),
   complex or frequency. It also has a sigma parameter for
   simultaneous gaussian smoothing. This is an incompatible
   change.  
   + "curvature" is 2x faster.
   + many manpage fixes 
   + various minor fixes

0.1 Initial release
   + I/O of image files in almost ANY format, using
   ImageMagick 5.4.2
   + display is done using scilab's own graphical window.
   + new functions with flexible, stable interface and 
   error treatment.
   + stable interfaces and error treatment in the
   previous functions
   + help pages for all the functions, with EXAMPLES
   sections.
   + demos
   + home page
   + nice photographs (thanks to Eduardo Justiniano)

0.0 FABBRI toolbox
   the ancestor of the SIP toolbox. Did very simple
   image processing, without well-defined interfaces
   for the functions. Almost no documentation. Had to
   rely on IMAGE toolbox to read in just PPM/PGM/PBM
   ascii image files and display with an external program.
