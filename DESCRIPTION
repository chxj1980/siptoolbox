Description: SIP stands for Scilab Image Processing toolbox. SIP intends to do
imaging tasks such as filtering, blurring, edge detection, thresholding,
histogram manipulation, segmentation, mathematical morphology, color image
processing, etc.  These operations are useful for problem solving in real-world
applications ranging from car motion planning to automatic diagnosis of medical
images.  SIP is meant to be a complete, useful, and FREE digital image
processing toolbox for Scilab.
