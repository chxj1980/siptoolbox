TODO
- use double buffering the new way. see beginning comment of sip-intro.dem

----------------------------------------------------------
Current bugs (with Scilab 5.3 Ubuntu 11.04)
- sip help section doesn't show up in the help index
- sip help doesn't work at all:

Got an IOException (JAR entry scilab_en_US_help/jhelpset.hs not found in /usr/share/scilab/contrib/sip-0.5.2-git/jar/scilab_en_US_help.jar)
Parsing failed for null


- interferometry gui doesn't work anymore (perhaps disable it)
- during the first demo, displaying with colormap 2 causes window to shrink.

----------------------------------------------------------
Scilab bugs
- cannot copy/paste from scilab window buffer (true for git version).
- graycolormap error check is wrong; it is not letting colormaps with less than
  3 colors (rows).
  /home/rfabbri/src/scilab/scilab/modules/graphics/macros/graycolormap.sci
  seems like all other colormaps suffer from the same issue.

----------------------------------------------------------
Website
- include gitweb link next to download to show recent commits + a link to the
  most recent ChangeLog.txt file.

----------------------------------------------------------
Thoughts
- does openjdk work well enough?
