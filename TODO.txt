TODO
- use double buffering the new way. see beginning comment of sip-intro.dem
- write a help intro
- put some pauses in the examples of the help pages since they will likely be
  executed with "play".
- fix some help links in the see also sections
- move the help files to new xml format (take a xml help file from the scilab
  source as a model)
- write help for sip_exec


Current bugs (with Scilab 5.3 Ubuntu 11.04)
------------

- in examples and demo, control the size of the window (imges too smal). This is
  crucial for the case of bin.xpm and bin.png
- interferometry gui interactive profile examination doesn't work anymore 
- make the help subtitle be "Functions" or something like that, instead of
  another SIP title.

Scilab bugs
-----------

- try sun-java for getting copy/paste to work and other stuff.

Website
-------

- include gitweb link next to download to show recent commits + a link to the
  most recent ChangeLog.txt file.

Thoughts
