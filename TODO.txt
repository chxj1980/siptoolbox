TODO
- use double buffering the new way. see beginning comment of sip-intro.dem
- write a help intro
- put some pauses in the examples of the help pages since they will likely be
  executed with "play".
- fix some help links in the see also sections
- write help for sip_exec


Leptonica Todo's (Including Google Summer of Code 2012)
----------------
- unsupervised classification of connected components, characters and words;
- digit recognition.
- a simple jbig2-type classifier, using various distance
      metrics between image components (correlation, rank
      hausdorff); see prog/jbcorrelation.c, prog/jbrankhaus.c
- a simple color segmenter, giving a smoothed image
      with a small number of the most significant colors.
- wordsinorder: detects words in a binary image (document understanding)
  - cool to check out if it works in arbitrary orientations
  - function to interface: pixGetWordBoxesInTextlines
- rank filters
  - pixRankFilterGray, 




Current bugs (with Scilab 5.3 Ubuntu 11.04)
------------

- in examples and demo, control the size of the window (imges too smal). This is
  crucial for the case of bin.xpm and bin.png
- interferometry gui interactive profile examination doesn't work anymore 
- make the help subtitle be "Functions" or something like that, instead of
  another SIP title.

Scilab bugs
-----------

- try sun-java for getting copy/paste to work and other stuff.

Website
-------

- include gitweb link next to download to show recent commits + a link to the
  most recent ChangeLog.txt file.

Thoughts
--------

- can openjdk work well enough?
