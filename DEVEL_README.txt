SIP - The Scilab Image Processing Toolbox
=========================================

The development version is unstable and subject to fast changes
without concerning any compatibility with previous versions. Be
sure to check out the SIP development home page at:

   - See the ChangeLog.txt file to see what's new

   - SIP uses GNU Libtool in order to build shared libraries on a
   variety of systems. While this is very nice for making usable
   binaries, it can be a pain when trying to debug a program. For
   that reason, compilation of shared libraries can be turned off
   by specifying the `--disable-shared' option to `configure'. This
   will make compilation much faster.
