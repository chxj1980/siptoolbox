Installation From Source
========================
   Sourcecode compilation is intended for developers and advanced users.
   Please use the binary version if you want an easier procedure for
   installing SIP.  However, the SIP toolbox sourcecode is very portable. 


UNIX/LINUX systems

   This version of SIP is easy to compile/install on UNIX-like
   systems, as it detects your system libraries automatically.
   However, as SIP makes strong code reuse, you will first have to
   install its requirements.

   The requirements for installing SIP from source are:
      - Scilab >= 4.0 (SIP seems to work even for Scilab 2.6).
      - AnImaL (An Imaging Library), latest version. You can
        download it at http://animal.sourceforge.net
      - ImageMagick
      - GCC compiler
      - groff text formatter (for help pages)
      - For the SIP Git version, you need to have recent autoconf, 
        automake, and libtool packages installed.

   1) AnImaL library
      This is SIP's internal image processing library. It has the core C
      routines to which SIP is just an interface with Scilab. Please read
      AnImaL's INSTALL.txt file that comes with the package before proceeding
      with SIP. 

            ./configure
            make
            make install

      (NOTE: if Animal was downloaded from Git, run `./autogen.sh' before the 
      above commands)

   2) You might have to type "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig". 
      Read man pkg-config for details

   3) Compile and Install SIP. Type:

            ./configure
            make 
            make install

      (NOTE: for the SIP Git version, type `./autogen.sh' before the above
      commands)

      This will install SIP in the default directory (SCI/contrib/sip).
      Maybe you will need to be root to issue "make install".
      If you want to change the installation directory, pass the
      directory to configure.  For example:

            ./configure --prefix=/home/you/sip
            make
            make install

      As the final user, *not* root, you may want SIP to be loaded
      automatically.  You may now type:
            make autoload

      This will add the necessary "exec" line to your .scilab file.
      Now you can start Scilab.

   For the details about SIP installation, please read the file
   "INSTALL_UNIX_DETAILED.txt".

   NOTE: SIP should be recompiled whenever Scilab is upgraded.


WIND0WS compilation

   It should be possible to compile SIP under windows, using any
   ANSI-C compiler. These include Borland C++, Visual C++, and
   gcc under MinGW (www.mingw.org) or Cygwin tools (www.cygwin.com)

   However, to install the wind*wz version from source, there is 
   no automatic procedure yet. For the instructions to
   compile the sources, using your favourite compiler see bellow:

   MinGW
      This is a native port of the GNU development tools (gcc, etc)
      for Windows. See www.mingw.org for installation intructions.
      Having installed MinGW and MSYS (unix shell), proceed as
      follows:
         - Install the ImageMagick delegates. You can download a
           binary version of these for mingw at:

           ftp://ftp.simplesystems.org/pub/outgoing/mingw-delegate-libs.tar.gz

         - Install ImageMagick the usual way:

               ./configure && make

         - Follow the instructions for installing SIP source
           version under Unix/Linux

   Borland free C++ compiler
      This is a free compiler, which you can get from:
      http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/
      Please contact Edson Manoel <emanoel@grad.icmc.sc.usp.br>,
      for instructions on compiling SIP using BCPP 5.5.

   Visual C++ compiler
      This is an expensive compiler, but very popular.
      Please contact Jean-Philippe Chancelier
      <jpc@cermics.enpc.fr> or Scilab Group <scilab@inria.fr> for
      instruction on compiling SIP using Visual C++.


Installation From Binaries  (NOT YET AVAILABLE)
==========================

WINDOWS  (not yet available) 
         
   1) Install SIP
      We suppose here that <PATH> stands for the path of the directory
      containing this README file.
      Execute, once, the following instruction 
      within Scilab:

               exec <PATH>\builder.sce 

      for example, on my machine that command is:

               exec 'c:\program files\sip-0.1.1-win\builder.sce'

      You will be asked to double-click any file inside ImageMagick
      directory. This is necessary because the SIP toolbox has to
      know where you have put ImageMagick.
      Now please restart the computer. 

   2) Load SIP
         Execute within scilab:

               exec <PATH>\loader.sce

         for example, on my machine that command is:

               exec 'c:\program files\sip-0.1.1-win\loader.sce'

         this will load the toolbox into scilab. Now type 

               sipdemo()

         to see if everything is working fine.
         You must type "exec <PATH>/loader.sce" in every SCILAB
         session that you want to use the toolbox. You can put
         this instruction in you ".scilab" startup file for
         automatic loading.

         As an example, below is the sequence I do on my own machine 
         for automatic loading:
            I - edit c:\autoexec.bat with notepad.
                Add the following line at the end of autoexec.bat:

                  SET HOME=C:\USER\RFABBRI

           II - edit .scilab in c:\user\rfabbri
                Add the following line:

                  exec 'c:\program files\sip-0.1.1-win\loader.sce'

         now reboot your machine. That's it! Every time I enter 
         scilab it already loads the SIP toolbox!
                  


UNIX/LINUX systems
   Download the appropriate binary package at
   http://siptoolbox.sf.net and read the INSTALL.txt file therein.
   Note that Unix binaries are specific for each scilab version.
